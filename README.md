War:

---> War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a card game typically played by two players. It uses a standard playing card deck.The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.
    
---> The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.
   
---> If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war".Both players place the next card of their pile face down (some variants have three face down cards) and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

Finally, Those who collect the 52 cards at first is declared as the winner !!!
